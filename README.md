# [PlayPunk](http://playpunk.com)
In this repository you will be able to find the source code for the [playpunk.com](http://playpunk.com) website, a website I entirely designed and coded. This was made for two giant names of the board game industry who are starting a new company. This website was developed in [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), SCSS, Vue Router and the i18n internationalization library.

### A few remarkable features:
- Big and scalable routing system (made using Vue Router)
- Full language translation capabilities (the website is currently translated in English and French). This was done by using Vue Router in combination with Vue i18n (a popular internationalization library).
- The whole website was made responsive (navigation bar, which also has a special underline hover effect, turns into burger menu; grids; media queries; thoughtful design; ...)
- Accordion menu on the press page. This page has a bunch of downloadable files with fast-loading thumbnails.
- A 404 page which you are redirected to if you enter an address like: playpunk.com/en/qwerty (made with Vue Router)
